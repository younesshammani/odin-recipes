    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    9 lasagna noodles
        2 cups ricotta cheese
        2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
        1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
        1 egg
        2 cups marinara sauce
        1 teaspoon dried basil
        1 teaspoon dried oregano
        Salt and pepper to taste
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        
        Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles until al dente. Drain and set aside.
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.
        Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
        Repeat the layers: marinara sauce, noodles, remaining ricotta mixture.
        Top with another layer of noodles and cover with the remaining marinara sauce.
        Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese over the top.
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden on top.
        Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
        Enjoy your classic lasagna, a timeless and comforting dish!
